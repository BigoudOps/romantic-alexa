For advance control on browser
`pip install pywhatkit`

To get wikipedia data
`pip install wikipedia`

To get funny jokes
`pip install pyjokes`

### For linux users
Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for `python2` and `pip3` refers to `python3`.
Install these too -

In case any error pops up install this -
`pip3 install portAudio`
